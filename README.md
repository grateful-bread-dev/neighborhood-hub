## Project Purpose

Neighborhood Hub was built as a web development course project exploring server-side programming, database integration, and community-driven UI design.  
The goal was to create a functional, minimalist alternative to modern social platforms — focusing on meaningful, local interactions rather than algorithms and feeds. If successful, our users find what they need, log off, and meet their neighbors in person.
